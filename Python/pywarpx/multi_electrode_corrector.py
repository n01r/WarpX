"""Quasi-static harmonic voltage clamp for driven embedded-boundary electrodes.

Controls quasi-static electrode-voltage estimates during an electromagnetic run
without a Poisson solve per step.

Per electrode ``k`` a charge-free unit field ``E_0k = -grad(phi_0k)`` is
precomputed once, with electrode ``k`` at 1 V and all others grounded. The
correction is a linear combination of these fields. The EB Poisson gradient and
native Maxwell divergence/curl need not form a compatible discrete complex, so
this does not imply that native ``div(E)`` or ``curl(E)`` is unchanged everywhere.
In particular the default ``actuator_gradient="eb_aware"`` field is not annihilated
by the Yee Faraday stencil and drives a spurious boundary ``B``;
``actuator_gradient="ordinary"`` selects the full-grid gradient, whose discrete
curl vanishes, and trades local accuracy at the conductor for that compatibility.

Per correction the effective voltages follow from the capacitance relation

    Q_j = Q_g,j + sum_k C_jk V_k   =>   V = C^-1 (Q - Q_g),

where ``C_jk = eps0 * oint_j E_0k . n dS`` is the precomputed vacuum capacitance
matrix, ``Q_j`` is the live EB-flux charge measurement for electrode ``j`` and
``Q_g,j`` is the plasma-induced charge with every electrode grounded. The feedback
is ``delta_V = relaxation * (V_target - V)``, applied as ``E += sum_k delta_V_k E_0k``.

``Q_g`` is observed either with a grounded Poisson solve (``qg_mode="grounded"``)
or, by default, with the discrete Shockley-Ramo pairing
``Q_g,k = -sum_a rho_a Psi_k[a]`` against the adjoint weighting potentials, which
needs no solve. ``Psi_k`` is built from the transpose of WarpX's own discrete EB
operator and charge functional; the plain unit-voltage basis is not the adjoint of
that functional on a non-symmetric cut-cell operator.

Usage::

    from pywarpx.multi_electrode_corrector import MultiElectrodeBiasCorrector
    from pywarpx.callbacks import (
        installafterEsolve,
        installafterInitatRestart,
        installafterInitEsolve,
    )

    corrector = MultiElectrodeBiasCorrector(
        sim=sim,
        correction_interval=10,
        electrodes=[
            {"name": "left", "region": "(x<0)", "potential": +300.0},
            {"name": "right", "region": "(x>0)", "potential": -700.0},
        ],
    )
    # afterInitEsolve does not run on a restart, so register both init hooks
    installafterInitEsolve(corrector.setup_after_init)
    installafterInitatRestart(corrector.setup_after_init)
    installafterEsolve(corrector.correct_field)

Supported envelope: driven (prescribed-potential) electrodes, grounded PEC outer
boundaries, and in RZ nodal CIC deposition without a charge filter. Floating
electrodes, circuit coupling and dielectric boundaries are not modelled.
Grounded-adjoint agreement validates the selected discrete charge measurement;
it does not by itself establish physical voltage control during particle collection.

    """Maintain several driven EB electrode potentials in EM mode.

    .. important::
       **No conductor surface may coincide with a domain boundary at any
       point.** Every embedded conductor must be strictly interior, with a
       layer of vacuum between it and the domain boundary. A conductor touching
       the boundary is electrically the same conductor as that boundary: the
       capacitance matrix then loses its reference, becomes non-symmetric and
       ill-conditioned (measured condition number 1.6e12 against 8.1 when
       separated), and no closed surface around the electrode can be drawn in
       vacuum. The vacuum layer is required by the electrostatics, not by the
       particles; none need ever enter it. Transverse domain boundaries should
       be Dirichlet, since only a boundary that can sink charge supplies the
       reference the matrix needs.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sim : picmi.Simulation
        The initialized PICMI simulation.
    correction_interval : int
        Apply the correction every this many steps.
    electrodes : list of dict
        One entry per electrode, with keys ``"name"`` (identifier),
        ``"region"`` (a parser expression ``w_k(x,y,z)``, nonzero on that
        electrode's surface) and ``"potential"`` (the target voltage in V).
        The regions should be close to disjoint indicators of the surfaces.
    relaxation : float, optional
        Feedback under-relaxation in (0, 1]. 1.0 reaches the target in one
        correction; smaller values soften the per-step jump.
    qg_mode : {"reciprocity", "grounded"}, optional
        How the grounded plasma charge is observed. ``"reciprocity"`` (default)
        pairs the deposited charge density with the adjoint weighting potentials.
        ``"grounded"`` performs a real grounded Poisson solve per call, which is
        exact but costs one MLMG solve.
    adjoint_tolerance : float, optional
        Relative residual tolerance for the adjoint weighting solves.
    adjoint_max_iterations : int, optional
        Maximum outer iteration count for the adjoint solves.
    verbose : bool, optional
        Print the capacitance matrix and the per-correction voltages.
    actuator_gradient : {"eb_aware", "ordinary"}, keyword-only, optional
        Which discrete gradient of the setup potentials becomes the unit actuator
        field. ``"eb_aware"`` (default) uses the shortened fluid length on cut
        edges, which is the locally more accurate field but is not annihilated by
        the Yee Faraday stencil: adding it drives a spurious boundary ``B``.
        ``"ordinary"`` uses WarpX's full-grid gradient, whose discrete curl
        vanishes, at the cost of a less accurate field next to the conductor. The
        choice applies only to the actuator setup solves. The charge observer, its
        capacitance measurement, the adjoint and the grounded cross-check are
        unchanged; the capacitance is always measured from the unit fields that
        are actually applied, so the feedback stays self-consistent either way.
        Keyword-only and last so that existing positional calls are unaffected.

    State contract for ``setup_after_init``
    ---------------------------------------
    Setup runs several one-off Poisson solves, each of which overwrites
    ``Efield_fp`` and the embedded-boundary potential parser. On return, the
    **valid** cells of ``Efield_fp`` and the parser expression are restored
    exactly. Guard cells are deliberately *not* restored: WarpX treats them as
    derived rather than as state -- ``OneStep_nosub`` refills them at the start of
    every step ("E and B are up-to-date inside the domain only",
    ``Source/Evolve/WarpXEvolve.cpp``), and both setup hooks run before the first
    step. The restoration is protected by ``try``/``finally``, so a failed solve
    cannot leave the live field or the parser holding a setup value.
